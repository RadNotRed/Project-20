Deck: This class represents a deck of 52 playing cards, and it contains a constructor, shuffle(), and drawCard() methods.
In the constructor, an empty cards ArrayList is initialized, and then 52 playing cards are created and added to the cards ArrayList.
The shuffle() method shuffles the cards ArrayList using the Collections.shuffle() method, while the drawCard() method removes and
returns the first card from the cards ArrayList. If the cards ArrayList is empty, the drawCard() method returns null.

Card: This is a record class with two fields, suit of type String and value of type int, and it overrides the toString() method
to return a string representation of the card in the format of "value of suit". The toString() method creates the string
representation of the card by concatenating the value and suit fields. If the value field is 1, 11, 12, or 13, the method
replaces the value with the corresponding name for Ace, Jack, Queen, or King, respectively, before concatenating it with the
suit field. Finally, the toString() method returns the string representation of the card.
