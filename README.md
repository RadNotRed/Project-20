# 1, 2, 3, I DELCARE WAR
## Project 20: War the Card Game.
### Create a project that uses at lest 2 classes, to create a full deck of playing cards to play the card game war for a player vs the computer.

You will have the game execute a maximum of 26 rounds of war... assuming that you did not have a tie during one of the rounds.

Hint: READ CHAPTER 14 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK!
